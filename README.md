# Virtual-OS
Builded a Virtual Operating System using go lang and fyne framework(used for buliding GUI of the operating system).
Basically, it consists of four apps(Calculator, Text Editor, Weather and Home Icon). I have integrated all of them in the Virtual Operating System.
For Weather App I have used an weather API which gives the information in the JSON format, then finally extracted the data from JSON file and displayed it.
Here are the Results...
